# React Architecture

- React
- Custom Create react app
- Reuse components
- Tests with React Testing Library

**This is your source code tree:**

```
src
|-- @types
|-- assets
|-- styles
|-- components
|-- containers
|-- helpers
|-- pages
|-- routes
|-- services
|-- App.tsx
|-- index.tsx
...
```
Every item created inside components, containers, pages... will be a folder with their code, the tests file, and to keep your code simple and short you can add extra files for helpers or styles it this folder. The folder structure will look like this:

```
components
|-- YouComponent
    |-- index.ts
    |-- ComponentName.test.ts
    |-- styles.ts
    |-- // Extra files for things like helpers or styles
...
```

# Folders description

### `./assets`

Here will be all your project assets as images, icons...

### `./components`

Components are presentational only elements, grouping UI items

### `./containers`

Containers are responsible for connecting components with services and global state management. All the logic stays here, to keep components only with visual concerns

### `./pages`

Pages are mapped in routes and have all the components needed to implement a functionality

### `./routes`

Routes contains the `react-router-dom` implementation to map the project's routes to the respective pages

### `./services`

Services are responsible to handle the connection with all external elements, like APIs

### `./helpers`

Directory to keep all `helpers` functions to share all over the project
